    "### Changelog\n",
    "\n",
    "- Version 1.0.\n",
    "    - Original Program\n",
    "- Version 1.1\n",
    "    - Adapted for new file names with country code.\n",
    "    - Added code to avoid processing files with wrong names.\n",
    "    - Solved bug in the code that plots a spectrum and the selected wavenumbers.\n",
    "- Version 2.0\n",
    "    - Added an algorithm for being able to read files with names without a country code.\n",
    "    - It plots a bar and whiskers graph with the results of the mosquitoes.\n",
    "    - Added an algorithm to detect when the selected wavenumbers are out of the measured ranges.\n",
    "- Version 3.0\n",
    "    - Supports ``.mzz`` files.\n",
    "- Version 3.1\n",
    "    - Supports the new (after Ifakara meeting) and the old naming systems.\n",
    "    - New wrong-mosquito-stubborn-namer-proof system.\n",
    "    - Included all the modifications from Loco Mosquito \"Mwanga edition\", including the possibility of using two wavenumbers to select ranges instead of individual peaks.\n",
    "    - Corrects the selection of peaks in case they have wavenumbers that are not in the spectral range.\n",
    "- Version 3.2\n",
    "    - Ready for the analysis of a large number of files in different folders.\n",
    "    - Makes a list with the files with wrong names.\n",
    "- Version 3.3\n",
    "    - Deals with errors in the dates of the mosquitoes.\n",
    "- Version 4.0\n",
    "    - Ignores the name of the ``*.tmp`` file inside the ``*.mzz`` file.\n",
    "    - Discriminates between the rearing conditions of the mosquitoes.\n",
    "    - Includes an algorithm to select what mosquitoes you want to use in the final matrix.\n",
    "- Version 4.1\n",
    "    - Added in tqdm to make use of a progress bar during the long phase of loading in spectra.\n",
    "    - Modified reading the spectra to include the country. Further changes throughout shift the spectral position in the matrices to acommodate the country matrix location.\n",
    "    - Added in a subtotal in the mosquito number summary display. \n",
    "    - **Version made with the help of Joshua Mitton, University of Glasgow**\n",
    "- Version 4.2\n",
    "    - Solved some bugs that affected the code (only in Ifakara).\n",
    "- Version 5.0\n",
    "    - Revised comments to facilitate use of the program."

    "If the spectra were measured after the change of the beamsplitter or after installing the ATR and the background was not correctly measured, the spectra will be with the interference of the water and CO<sub>2</sub> spectra. In the case of water vapour, its IR spectrum has three bands very noisy: one between 4000 and 3400 cm<sup>-1</sup>, other between 2200 and 1300 cm<sup>-1</sup> and the last one starts to appear below 800 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Because the second band appears exactly were the most interesting bands of the mosquitoes are, we are going to use the first band to detect the spectra contaminated by the water vapor and remove it from our data. In order to do that we check how smooth are the spectra between 3900 and 3500 cm<sup>-1</sup>, fitting that region to a polynomial. Only the spectra without noise will fit well."

    "Bruker spectrometers sometimes measure spectra whose characteristics have been masked by a high-absorbance band covering the entire mid-infrared region. I do not know the origin of this band. I used to think it was due to the interaction of the ATR crystal with the metallic anvil, but now I'm inclined to think it's due to some vibration or shock during measurement. Sometimes these spectra pass the previous filters and it is necessary to remove them. To do it that we are going to do is to select the wavenumber with less signal from the mosquito (this wavenumber is usually 1900 cm<sup>-1</sup>) and look for outliers at that frequency."
